# IP S7 LINK .NET SDK Docs
Here you will find documentation files and code snippets for C# and VB.NET to document the development of SIMATIC S7 connected applications using our IP S7 LINK .NET SDK. The files in this repository are used to share some documentation related files among the different platforms we're using to document our IP S7 LINK .NET SDK.

## Code Snippets

The code snippets in this repository are defined as they are and do not (necessarily) implement a whole scenario. Therefore they do not need to be standalone executable without fulfilling additional requirements. However we want to motiviate you to use them as reference regarding your own purpose to simplify some common implementation tasks for you.

The whole code snippets listed in this repository are linked into our documentation on [docs.traeger.de](https://docs.traeger.de/en/software/sdk/s7/net)
